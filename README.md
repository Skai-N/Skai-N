## Hey, I'm Skai ðŸ¤™

As a junior studying computer science and entrepreneurship at Cornell University, I'm passionate about using technology and innovation to solve complex issues!

My interests include machine learning, high-performance computing, quantum computing, and social entrepreneurship. To further these interests, I started my own nonprofit called Food for All NYC, joined the National Society of Black Engineers, the Cornell Data Science project team, and serve as a mentor for LinkedIn's ASCEND program.
